## Bugs

- TODO When you draw into a blackjack state turns to PlayerBlackJack before stand can be hit, make drawing blackjack auto-stand and play blackjack animation

## Development

- TODO Show scores on side
- TODO show chat actions on the opposite side of the scores "!hit or !stand", hide when no longer chat's turn
- TODO If player busts, State.PlayerBust should take priority instead of the both bust state.

## Quality of life

- TODO Player action text is too big
