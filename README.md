## Bugs

- TODO Push Gameover text so narrow that subtitle is hard to read. Maybe change subtitle to something short like: It's a tie!

## Development

- TODO show chat actions on the opposite side of the scores "!hit or !stand", hide when no longer chat's turn

## Quality of life

- TODO Player action text is too big
- TODO Player cards go up too high, dealer cards deal a little too low
