## Bugs

- TODO Cards have 1 pixel bleeding on sprite sheet, consider moving all sprites right 1 or 2 pixels
- TODO Natural blackjack tint needs to happen AFTER action text (callback)

## Development

- TODO Convert action text to a onDone callback
- TODO show chat actions on the opposite side of the scores "!hit or !stand", hide when no longer chat's turn
