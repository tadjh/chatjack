## Bugs

- TODO Player Turn Animation seems to be happening after hole card reveal?
- TODO Entity onEnd seems to fire instantly
- TODO Restart button doesn't work
- TODO X button doesn't work
- TODO Timer isn't destroyed when early player action occurs (button press)
- TODO Player turn animation complete is firing twice

## Development

- TODO show chat actions on the opposite side of the scores "!hit or !stand", hide when no longer chat's turn
- TODO Timer duration from query parameters

## Quality of life

- TODO Bust and opacity drop should happen AFTER card finishes animating
- TODO Bust opacity could be lower
- TODO use-canvas should return composite component Canvas instead of the individual refs
