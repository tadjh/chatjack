## Bugs

- TODO Cards have 1 pixel bleeding on sprite sheet, consider moving all sprites right 1 or 2 pixels
- TODO Cards are a litte blurry? maybe Math.floor needed

## Development

- TODO Convert action text to a onDone callback
- TODO Add hand owner next to scores
- TODO Add action timer top left corner
- TODO show chat actions on the opposite side of the scores "!hit or !stand", hide when no longer chat's turn
- TODO Consider removing Player array since this will always be single player

## Quality of life

- TODO Bust and opacity drop should happen AFTER card finishes animating
- TODO Stack the deck for testing purposes
