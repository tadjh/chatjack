## Bugs

- TODO Dealer hit cards are not animating
- TODO Dealer bust cards don't lose transparency
- TODO Dealer animation will show hole card again during resolve probably due to card.id mismatch
- TODO Dealer action text shows in the wrong spot. Position top isn't implemented
- TODO When you draw into a blackjack state turns to PlayerBlackJack before stand can be hit, make drawing blackjack auto-stand and play blackjack animation

## Development
